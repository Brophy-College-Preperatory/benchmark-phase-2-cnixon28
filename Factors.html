        <h1>Factors</h1>

    <main>
        <p>When getting a car you need to think about the car like what it can do, how much it costs and gas mileage.</p>
        <h2>Gas Mileage</h2>
        <p>If your car has good gas mileage where it can go more miles before you need to get gas again it will save you time at the station and money on gas. A smaller car will usually get better gas mileage and a larger car will have worse.</p>
        <h2>Car Costs</h2>
<p>This is the biggest factor when getting a car and everyone has their own budget for the car. An expensive car will look drive and feel better.</p>
        <h2>Looks</h2>
<p>The looks of a car might be the most important for you as a kid but as you get older they become less important and the other factors get more important.Some people like to be higher up than other people on the road so they prefer driving a higher car. The color is up to you but sometimes they will not have the color you want. A really nice car is usually a very expensive car though.</p>
        <h2>Safety</h2>
<p>Especially if this is the first car you are getting, you want a car that is safe in case you crash it.A bigger car made of good material is going to be a safe car and a small car is ussually less safe.</p>
        <h2>Driving Comfort</h2>
<p>Driving Comfort is not the most important factor but it changes how much you want to drive your car.You want a car that drives smoothely and is comfortable. </p>
